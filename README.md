# Even Number Checker

This is a simple Java program that checks if a number entered by the user is **even** or **odd**, and whether it is within the range of **0 to 10**.

## 📌 What it does

- Prompts the user to enter a number between 0 and 10.
- Checks if the number is in the valid range.
- Tells the user if the number is even or odd.
- If the number is not between 0 and 10, it shows a warning message.

## 🧪 Example

```
Enter a number between 0 and 10:
4
The entered number is even.
```

```
Enter a number between 0 and 10:
9
The entered number is odd.
```

```
Enter a number between 0 and 10:
15
The number is not between 0 and 10.
```
